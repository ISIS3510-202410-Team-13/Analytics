The Analytics Pipeline for UniSchedule encompasses dashboards aimed at providing insightful reports with visualizations to answer critical business questions. These dashboards serve as a tool for gaining valuable insights into user behavior, app usage patterns, and other relevant metrics. The pipeline is designed to enable informed decision-making and improve overall user experience within the UniSchedule ecosystem.

## Architecture

We implemented analytics endpoints in the backend to log user interactions with the UniSchedule app. These logs are stored in Firestore and BigQuery databases for further processing. The data is then transformed and aggregated to generate reports that are visualized in Looker Studio. The reports are accessible to stakeholders for monitoring and decision-making purposes.
